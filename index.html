                  While the Indian education system concentrates on loading as much information as possible in the minds of the students, it rarely enables the teachers to draw out their inherent potential. The change was needed to stop teachers from directing and feeding in answers in the minds of the learners; to bring about a paradigm shift by getting the teachers to become facilitators of knowledge; and to help the learners to extract solutions, question preset theories and be responsive and adaptable. Thus, a unique pedagogy had to be built to fulfill this vision and philosophy.

Another factor to be kept in mind is that children need to become equipped with 21st century skills, social and emotional skills while developing themselves in areas they have talent in. They need to be proficient in creative and critical thinking, analysis, reasoning, problem solving, synthesis, data handling, applying their learning, and presentation skills. They need the best pedagogic practices, the latest technological tools and liberation from the tyranny of rote learning.

At the end of the years of schooling, the confident and responsible person that needs to emerge out of the school system requires careful nurturing. Thus, the system needs to be given opportunities to build values unconsciously in the minds of the child so s/he becomes an asset to society and becomes a harbinger of progress.

                  The curriculum in the Millennium Schools is powered by the Millennium Learning SystemTM. Every tangible for MLS has been developed at the Research and Development Division of Education Quality Foundation of India, with a focused outcome in mind. This outcome is clearly understood through our vision for every child who enters the system. Age appropriate, psychologically mapped and pedagogically apt tangibles are used at every level of the Millennium Learning System. Some of these are the books, the assessment system and the lesson plans.

                  <b>IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ACADEMICS </b>

The Millennium School (TMS) believes there is more to life than academic success. We actively uphold a balanced approach to education; one that develops students who excel both inside and outside the classroom. We believe that learning is a lifelong process that occurs both in and out of the classroom. <br>

We prepare students for the new and emerging challenges of the 21st century. Life at TMS includes just about everything that you do during your years here as a student from academics to sports, from drama to travel. Each child is encouraged to take part in of co-curricular activities, enabling him to spread his wings wider. We offer a diverse range of activities, from experiential learning programs to numerous athletics endeavors, arts experiences, and student activities and clubs. <br>

Four major domains of talent development laid out by the Millennium Learning SystemTM (MLS) are: <br> 

<b>Intellectual abilities:</b> Encompassing the areas of language, mathematics and science, intellectual ability development including reading, writing and oral communication, traditional and applied mathematics, space programs, robotics, inventions, forensic skills and other inspiring learning projects. <br>

<b>Creative abilities: </b>Covering confidence building and mind-expanding project areas such as Indian and world vocal and instrumental music, dance, drama, photography, painting and sculpture. <br> 

<b>Physical and Mental abilities:</b> Offering a variety of physical and mental activities for a healthy young mind and body including yoga, athletics, team sports, adventure sports and chess. <br> 

<B> Social abilities:</B> To enable each child to improve his interactions with classmates, teachers and parents, there are various projects which deal with concepts such as development of leadership qualities, problem solving abilities and interpersonal communication. <br>
 
We also encourage students from an early age to take responsibility for their community. Students contribute to decision-making in the school through student councils. Activities involving the wider community generally focus on developing a sense of responsibility for the common good. <Br> 

The school runs a house system. Every student belongs to one of four houses. Within their houses students take positions of responsibility, compete against other houses in sport and music and work towards common goals in a range of areas. <Br>

Thoughtful and motivated counselors, teachers, and administrators work with students and their families to ensure that all students have the opportunity to reach their full potential at TMS. <br> 
                  
                  </Br></Br>

              <img class="img-responsive col-lg-5  col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12" src="sports.jpg">
              <p class="list-group-item-text">
                 Physical activities play an essential role in the holistic development of students. It not only keeps them fit but fosters to their physical, social and emotional health. Along with catering to their physical and mental fitness it teaches them group commitment, team work, individual discipline and helps them create an apt attitude towards life in general. <br> 

We, at The Millennium School, firmly believe in all round development of our students and thus we emphasize equally on both academics and co-curricular activities. We envisage a system which aims at a multifaceted flowering of the child's physical, emotional, mental and spiritual personality. <br>

Well structured sports program and modified games guided by expert coaches at The Millennium School helps children develop fundamental movement skills and develop gross motor skills exclusively for the pre-primary kids. To ensure regular participation of students in different sports, we have made games curriculum a part of our educational process. <br>

The games offered are: <br> 

Taekwon-do, Table Tennis, Basket Ball, Badminton, Volleyball, Hockey, Croquet, Football, Cricket, Skating, Archery

                 The Millennium Schools’ Art and Craft program connects creativity and innovation at an early stage of children’s development. The program is designed to build skills, develop competencies and provide resources that support creative learning for our students. Most importantly, it gives children the chance to use their imagination. <br>

              <p class="list-group-item-text">
                 Theatre enables the development and understanding of the self as well as the exploration of self in relation to others. It helps the development of critical empathy for fellow humans and towards the natural, physical and social worlds. <br> 

Through theatre/street-plays students are given opportunity to create their own dramas and attend plays presented by others also bringing about social awareness through street-plays. Through this medium of learning, students are transported to worlds past, present, and future --- the ultimate in "virtual reality." <br> 

“Theatre not only includes acting, it also involves dance, painting, costume designing, stage designing, an understanding of lighting and other things." At The Millennium School drama fulfils student's psychological needs of free expression and imagination, builds their characters, and finally through stories leads them to perform for an audience. <br>
